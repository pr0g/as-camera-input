# as-camera-input

## Overview

Experimental composable camera controllers for 3D applications

## Detail

`as-camera-input` uses [as-camera](https://github.com/pr0g/as-camera) to build interesting behaviours on top of it.

Bindings/mappings must be provided to go from the native platform input to `as-camera-input`.

`as-camera-input` can be used easily with CMake (either by installing it and using `find_package` or with `FetchContent`).
